# 🌐 OpenYaBandha
"OpenYaBandha" was built to solve a simple but common campus problem — "Is that shop open or closed right now?" Students often waste time walking across campus only to find the shop, canteen, or any service point closed.

This website provides real-time status updates of shops within the campus, helping students save time and plan better. 

OpenYaBandha is a full-stack web application built with ❤️ by Muragesh in just **9 hours**. It's a platform designed for collaboration, ideation, or interaction (based on your vision), and it's my **first-ever hosted backend project** — making a step forward in my dev journey

## 🚀 What it Includes

- ✅ Frontend:  React
- ✅ Backend: Node.js + Express.js
- ✅ Database: MongoDB Atlas (cloud hosted)
- ✅ API: RESTful API endpoints for creating and retrieving data
- ✅ Hosting: Hosted and running live at https://bandh-ya-open-frontend-git-main-murageshs-projects.vercel.app/

As a beginner who built this in **just 9 hours**, I’m proud to say everything is live and working — *but* there's one big bug in the website that doesn't affect security(bcz of my presence of mind) or major functionality. I’ll squash that bug soon when I get some time 😅

Also, I plan to add a few **navigation buttons in the navbar** to improve user experience in the next update.
